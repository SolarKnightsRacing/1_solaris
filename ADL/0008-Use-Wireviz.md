## Context and Problem Statement

We must decide on a diagramming tool for electrical systems.

## Decision Drivers

* Free: No Rapid Harness sponsorship :(
* Version control: It would be useful to have a text-based tool so that version control can effectively track changes.

## Considered Options

* Rapid Harness
* WireViz
* AutoCad Electrical

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: WireViz

### Consequences

* Good, because it is text based. This means it works well with version control.
* Good, because it is flexable.
* Good, because it automatically generates a BOM.
* Bad, because somewhat difficult to learn.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Rapid Harness

* Good, because it is easier to use.
* Good, because {argument b}
* Neutral, because Knights Racing Formula uses it.
* Bad, because expensive.
* Bad, because proprietary file format.

### WireViz

  ### Autocad Electrical System

  {example | description | pointer to more information | ...}

  *Good, because plenty of free resources to learn it.
  *Good, provides version control through Autodesk's environment.
  * Nuetral, Industry standard for developing any electrnic schema or wiring diagram.
  * Bad, Is not text-based.
