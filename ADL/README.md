# Architecture Decision Log (ADL) README

This folder holds all of the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the vehicle.
The first record should be the vehicle name.

## ADR Template
The following is a template for an ADR with a name ####-Title.md e.g. 0000-ADR-Template.md
The first four digits should be a chronological index of the ADRs.
The document must include the .md extention.
The first thing in the document must be the following YAML front-matter/metadata.

```YAML

## Context and Problem Statement

{Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences or in the form of an illustrative story. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question and add links to collaboration boards or issue management systems.}

## Decision Drivers

### Confirmation

{Describe how the implementation of/compliance with the ADR can/will be confirmed. Are the design that was decided for and its implementation in line with the decision made?
